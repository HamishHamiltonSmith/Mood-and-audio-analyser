# Mood-and-audio-analyser

**What it does**

This is a gui aplication which I designed for the analysis of audio files. It takes in audio files of the wav format and will allow you to visualise the audio in matplotlib using FFT for frequency analysis. You can get values like the average frequency and amplitude of the file and can also run a mood detection script that based on a few variables (age, gender, pitch and in the future amplitude) which will return a guess of the mood you were in when you spoke
